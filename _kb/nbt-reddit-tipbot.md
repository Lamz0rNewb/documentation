The NuBit Reddit Tipping bot is an easy way to help spread the word about NuBits and to show appreciation for a good post on Reddit. NuBits are ideal for this purpose as 1NBT = $1.

To get started with the bot you need to [register](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=nbtip&subject=register&message=%2Bregister) by sending a PM to the nbtip user (/u/nbtip) with the text `+register` in the body of the message.
After you receive your confirmation, you can send NuBits to the supplied address and start tipping.

Tipping is easy. In a post simply type `+/u/nbtip` to call the tipping bot, followed by a number. That number of NuBits will be sent to the main poster, or the user you are replying to.
You can optionally include an @username to send directly to that user or any NuBit address to send to that address.

**Examples:**

{% highlight text %}
+/u/nbtip 2
{% endhighlight %}

Send 2 NuBits to the OP or the user you are replying to

+/u/nbtip @user1 2
Send 2 Nubits to user1

To make tipping more fun, you can specify a keyword instead of an amount. A full list of the keywords available as well as a fuller explanation of how the bot works is available on the [Bots' Wiki](http://reddit.com/r/NuBitsTippingBot/wiki/index)
